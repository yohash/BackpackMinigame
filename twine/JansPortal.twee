You look up at the CASTLE. You never managed to see the KING. SEWARD and his MOB will likely be slaughtered. And, as much as you hated it, you'll never return to the world you came from again. 

You feel that familiar anger rise. But only for a fleeting moment. There's nothing to do with that feeling now. 

As you lose consciousness, you think back on the choices you've made. You wish you had brought something to protect you against all those arrows. Why would you leave something like BODY ARMOR behind? You try and retrace your steps, regretting every decision you've made, as the new world you’ve found goes black.

Walking out of RAMBO’S, you literally run into GRETA and GOTH GRRL, outside for their smoke break. You have to grab GOTH GRRL to keep yourself from knocking her over completely.

GOTH GRRL: Oh my actual GOD.

GRETA: BERT. Do NOT touch my…

She suddenly clocks that you are holding bulletproof BODY ARMOR. Her eyes go wide.

GRETA: Look, Bert, I’m sorry. About your paycheck. And firing you. It was three strikes—that comes from corporate. Whatever you’re planning, please…

You think of Jan's cellar door, and panic. 

BERT: Did Ernesto tell you my plan?

GRETA: Just not me, Bert. OK, remember I turned you on to the Gregorian Chant thing? That was cool, right? We’re friends, right?

You look down at the BODY ARMOR. Suddenly you understand. The girls stare at you, the cigarettes turning to ash in their hands. It's not anger exactly, but it is an idea... <<set $ANGRY = false>>

<<if $ANGER>>BERT: Greta. I don’t know if I can forgive you. But I like your friend. So, for her sake, I’ll give you one chance to… RUN.

They do not hesitate; high-pitched screams fade as they tear ass around the corner in platform leather boots, <<else>>You could scare them. But it feels too mean. And you have a bigger purpose now. Impressing her friend.

BERT: Greta. I forgive you. 

<<if $smokes>>You pull GRETA'S SMOKES out of your BACKPACK and return them to her.<<else>>BERT: Can I share a smoke with you?

GREAT hesitates, glances at the BODY ARMOR, and hands you a smoke.<</if>>
<<if $lightergrt || $lighterern>>BERT: Here's a light.

They nod as you use the LIGHTER to light their cigarettes. You try to catch GOTH GRRL's eye, but she won't look at you.<<else>>BERT: Got a light?

GOTH GRRL holds out a lighter. You try to catch her eye, but she won't look at you.<</if>><<if $lightergrt>>
GRETA: Is that my lighter?

She snatches it from your hand. 

GRETA: God Bert, you need to change.<<else>><</if>>
Suddenly GOTH GRRL wrinkles her nose. So does GRETA. Then you taste it too. 

GRETA: BERT, what the actual fuck? Did you dip these in shit?

Seems everything that was in the BARN got tainted. The girls turn and stomp off,<</if>>flinging their cigarettes over their shoulders. You feel <<if $ANGER>>satisfied<<else>>hopeless<</if>>. Then you notice the lit cigarettes rolling toward the trailer. The one filled with fireworks.

You leap after them, trying to stomp them out before they roll underneath the...

\:: Scene11A
DRAGON’S BREATH FIREWORKS

Whew. All cigarettes out. You're wiping the flopsweat from your face when you hear a familiar voice…

JEFFREY: No smoking.

His Little Lordship sits in the trailer, surrounded by empty smoothie cups and fireworks—WHIZARD WHANGER, DRAGON OF DOOMSDAY, and EXPLODING ARCHER—priced $2–$401.

Except the ROMAN CANDLES on the front counter, under a sign that reads “On sale. $1. Fireballs.” They’re next to some LIGHTERS and MATCHES.

JEFFREY: That’s thu-reeee dollars.

BERT: Who’s in charge here?

JEFFREY: Dad’s gone. Buy something or leave. Sale’s over.

Jeffrey tips the $1 sale sign face-down. Rolling your eyes, you plunk your last dollar on the counter, pick up the <<if $romancand>>ROMAN CANDLE<<elseif $matchbook>>MATCHBOOK<<else>>LIGHTER<</if>>, and turn to go.<<set $cash1 = false>>

JEFFREY: <<if $THREWcups>>I saw you throw a cup at a dog.<<else>>I saw you bark at those dogs.<</if>>

You reach for him, furious. He dodges. So you <<if $romancand>>brandish your ROMAN CANDLE like a sword and try and poke JEFFREY with it.<<else>>pick up a ROMAN CANDLE from the box on the counter and try to whack JEFFREY on the head with it.<</if??

JEFFREY: <<if not $romancand>>THEEEEFF!! <<else>><</if>>DAAAAAAAD!!

The real RAMBO bursts forth from GUNZ ’N AMMO and roars like an armed grizzly bear. You grasp your ROMAN CANDLE like a baton and run as fast as you can from the parking lot, thankful you’re wearing the BODY ARMOR.<<set $romancand = true>>

[[Back to MA'S HOUSE|Scene12A]]


:: Scene11BSupress {"position":"1075,2225","size":"100,100"}
You calmly unlatch the flip up window cover of the trailer, and lower the plank of wood over JEFFREY's smug little face. 

JEFFREY: DAAAAAAAD!!

The real RAMBO bursts forth from GUNZ ’N AMMO and roars like an armed grizzly bear. You grasp your backpack and run as fast as you can from the parking lot, thankful you’re wearing the BODY ARMOR.

[[Back to MA'S HOUSE|Scene12A]]


:: Scene12A {"position":"900,2500","size":"100,100"}
MA REYNOLD'S HOUSE

When you return to MA’s house, she’s not there. You take the opportunity to make your final preparations before heading back to Jan's cellar door. You open MA’s kitchen pantry, looking for anything that might help in a castle siege.

The shelves are barren. You forgot that her almost every meal is cigarettes. All that remains in the pantry are some old LOLLIPOPS, a rhinestone-studded pink FLEA COLLAR that used to belong to NED's cat, and a can of FABREEZE. <<set $romancand = true>><<set $lighterram = true>><<set $matchbook = true>><<set $lollipops = true>><<set $fleacollar = true>><<set $fabreeze = true>>

[[Open your BACKPACK|backpackmenu12]]


:: Scene12B {"position":"1150,2500","size":"100,100"}
Just as you zip up your over-stuffed bag, NED walks in, eating a bag of CHEETOS. It really annoys you that he dresses like an accountant—pocket protector and all. He adjusts his bowtie, leaving Cheeto dust on the edge.

NED: Stealing from your own mother.

BERT: This is my house. Ma said I could…

NED: Stay here for $400. But I don’t think you’ve paid. I can check your account on the spreadsheet.

BERT: You can’t control everybody with Excel.

He pops a Cheeto in his mouth and eyes <<if $bodyarmor>>the BODY ARMOR sticking out of your BACKPACK.<<else>>the BODY ARMOR you left on the floor.<</if>>

NED: Is someone after you? Do you need protection from the subterranean sheep next door?

MA told him. Now you're doubly annoyed. <<if $bodyarmor>>To freak him out, you take the bulletproof vest out of your BACKPACK and put it on. You grab MA’s TIE-DYED ROBE off the back of the kitchen chair and drape it over your BODY ARMOR.<<else>>But you do need a costume. You grab MA’s TIE-DYED ROBE off the back of the kitchen chair and put it on.<</if>> Looking past NED, you notice the sun is setting behind Jan's house. Time to go.

You turn to NED, who is clearly about to comment on your new fashion choice.

<<if $pick === "Anger">>BERT: Know what, Ned? I’ve got another place to stay. You’re just Ma’s employee. Unpaid. Go fuck yourself.<br><br>You shove past NED, snatching the CHEETO bag out of his hand.

You scramble across the driveway between the two houses, tripping over the ROBE. You look up, to see if JAN is still watching from the upstairs window, but nothing moves. The FOR SALE sign in front of the house is gone.

The last rays of light are just framing the CELLAR DOOR. The scrawny cat is there again, looking hungry. <<if $cheetos2>>You take off your BACKPACK, and squat down to offer her NED's bag of CHEETOS. <<if $cheetos>>You decide you should keep your own bag of CHEETOS in your BACKPACK. <</if>>She eats them, gratefully.<<elseif $lollipops>>You take off your BACKPACK, looking for something for her to eat.

BERT: Here goes, <<if $cheetos2>>Snack<<else>>Magic<</if>> Cat.

You fling the CELLAR DOOR open, and... look down into JAN’s empty basement. There’s just a shopping cart down there, missing all its wheels.

BERT: Oh, right.

You close the doors. You pick up your BACKPACK, put it on, and try again. This time, when you open the DOOR, there’s no shopping cart. Instead, it’s a fathomless darkness and a familiar smell. You hold your nose and...

[[JUMP IN|Scene13B]]


:: Scene13B {"position":"1075,2650","size":"100,100"}
...to a pile of shit. It's the...

PEASANT'S BARN

BERT: Yes! FUCK YES!

You stand up. The sheep bleat the same distressed greeting. <<if $fabreeze>>

You whip the can of FABREZE out of your BACKPACK and give the barn a good long spray. Like, really long. The sheep go quiet. Maybe that was too long.<<else>>The smell is awful.<</if>> You cough and stumble for the door.

Outside, the rolling hills are edged with dusk, the sun going down just beyond the CASTLE, which is lit up with torches. The scene is set.

You cinch the TIE-DYED ROBE tightly around you<<if $bodyarmor>>, and pat the BODY ARMOR underneath<<else>><</if>>.

[[March toward the PEASANT’S HUT|Scene14A]]

SEWARD'S HUT

You can already hear the crying of babies inside. You steal yourself. You are a Wizard, Level 6. You are...

CICILIA: Rambo!?!

CICILIA is lounging on the straw bed, <<if $LEFTbong>>drinking ale from your BONG. She’s clearly sauced. <<else>>she looks exhuasted. <</if>>Her babies, all three of them, wake up and start screaming when you walk in. You could have sworn there were two last time. <<if $lollipops>>You pull the LOLLIPOPS from your backpack and pop one in the mouth of each baby. They quiet down.<<else>><</if>>

CICILIA: My hero. I told SEWARD you’d return. <<if $LEFTbong>>We drink!

She offers the sloshing BONG of cloudy ale to you.

BERT: That’s not actually how you use a…<<else>><</if>>

CICILIA: You seek audience with the king…

BERT: Yes.

CICILIA: …to argue for my sister’s safe return.

She winks. Is she flirting or suggesting that…

BERT: Listen, I’m not very good with social cues and…

CICILIA: She’s the most beautiful girl in the village, you know. And unmarried. Unsullied. We think. A Wizard for a husband! What girl should be so lucky?

BERT: Are you trying to seduce me on behalf of your…

CICILIA: Legs like this!

CICILIA lifts her skirts. You turn your gaze, instinctively. When you turn back to peek, she catches you, and is suddenly mad.

CICILIA: Go! She awaits!

[[To the CASTLE|Scene14B]]


:: Scene14B {"position":"1125,2800","size":"100,100"}
You tighten your backpack straps, and open the door to the HUT. Only to be met by THE VILLAGE MOB. You immediately slam it closed. SEWARD bursts in.

SEWARD: What ho! The great one return’d!

CICILIA: Told you.

BERT: The mob…

SEWARD: Steadfast fellows! I think may would join us, to approach the castle walls. But some are not convinced you're truly a wizard. Can you produce some of that magic you displayed before?

You're ready for this. You reach into your BACKPACK. 
<<if $smokes || $orcking || $dice || $baseball>><<if $orcking>>

BERT: Oh, and I brought you something!

You pull out the rhinestone-studded pink FLEA COLLAR and fasten it around SEWARD’s neck.

BERT: This collar… er, necklace will take care of your fleas.

SEWARD: My curse is lifted? Oh, mighty one.

Clearly moved, he takes a deep, unnecessary bow.<<else>><</if>>

CICILIA: Beshrew this, must I do everything?

CICILIA pushes you both outside…

[[...in to the FARMYARD|Scene14C]]

…where a hush falls over the MOB at the sight of you. You stand up straight and sweep your TIE-DYED ROBE in front of you. <<if $bodyarmor>>You like the way the BODY ARMOR makes your chest look bigger.<<else>><</if>>

SEWARD: Fellow liegemen, we’ve long suffered the King’s cruel hand.

MOB: Yeah! Fie upon him! And his wizard! The devil is insatiable!

CICILIA: Rambo will free your sisters and daughters and liberate us all!

A cheer goes up from the gathered crowd. You raise a hand in protest. This is not exactly what you had in mind.

CICILIA: Don’t come back without her.

CICILIA: Storm the castle!

MOB: The Wizard of STRIPMALLSHIRE! The Fearless RAMBO!

CICILIA pushes a shield and pack into SEWARD’s hands, and the two of you are swept away at the head of the angry mob.

ROAD TO THE CASTLE

You march with the MOB following, SEWARD by your side. You eye SEWARD’s shield—it looks identical to ERNESTO’s. <<if $shield>>You pull your HALF SHIELD out of your BACKPACK. You wish you'd repaired it before now, but it's nice to have some protection. <<else>>You wish you had brought it with you.<</if>>

BERT: So, is there a plan? I’m worried this will look… aggressive. I’m not even sure why I wanted to talk to the King.

SEWARD: Your powers will protect us.

BERT: Speaking of... you haven’t seen my, uh, cell phone, have you?

SEWARD: I cry your mercy?

BERT: A little square… Wizard’s box. It lights up. Never mind. Seward, about your King… He has a wizard?

SEWARD: Indeed. Very much so.

BERT: Does the wizard look like me? I mean, does he have, uh… devices?

SEWARD: I believe he has a torture rack. And an iron maiden. A screaming susan. A catapult for humans, which…

BERT: No, like the wizard box, or this.

The MOB is restless. A hush falls over them, as they pack in tight around you.

<<if $papertow || $trophy>>SEWARD: We need a banner of arms!

You reach into your BACKPACK, and pull out the <<if $papertow>>PAPER TOWELS<</if>><<if $papertow && $trophy>> and the<</if>><<if $trophy>> TROPHY<</if>>.

You start to speak, without even knowing what you are saying. Your speech is a jumble of clichés, high-school pep talks, and lines you can barely remember from Braveheart. You have no idea what you are trying to say. So you try to wrap it up.

BERT: …and in conclusion, we’ll just have to roll the dice, which as an expression means, uh… never mind. For STRIPMALLSHIRE!

THE CASTLE

As you lead them toward the CASTLE you start to feel extremely nervous. There are two stag heads mounted on pikes in front of the gate. Somehow you hadn’t noticed those last time. The same ARCHER who shot at you appears on the ramparts. <<if $papertow || $trophy>>SEWARD raises your banner of arms.<<else>><</if>>

ARCHER: He’s back.

BERT: RAMBO OF STRIPMALLSHIRE requests an audience with your…

ARCHER #2: Is he trying to say he’s from Worcestershire?

ARCHER: Matters not.

They notch their bows, and ZHWING—here come the arrows.

You feel the strong instinct to RUN.<<set $ANGRY = false>>

<<if $bodyarmor || $shield>>THWAP. An arrow hits you square in the back. You scream. <<if $shield>>But the SHIELD, lodged in your BACKPACK has protected you. It's incredible luck.

BERT: No! Wait! My magic will protect us!

You squat down to unzip your BACKPACK. SEWARD remains by your side, cowering behind his shield. More archers appear on the ramparts. ZSHWAP. ZSHWONK. The arrows are coming faster and heavier now.

[[Search your BACKPACK|Scene15B]]<<else>>THWAP. An arrow hits you square in the back. You scream and fall over.

On the ground, the pain hits. You look down. An arrow, deep in your love handle. Muscle tissue and bone peeking through. A pool of blood growing quickly on the grass. A static hiss fills your ears. You tilt your head back and moan. You're dying.

[[Look to the CASTLE|Ending1]]<</if>>


:: Scene15B {"position":"1175,2950","size":"100,100"}
You start to unzip it when... ZHONK—an arrow lodges in the ground beside your BACKPACK. You crawl away from it in terror. You don't want to get hit again. 

ARCHER: Release the dogs!

It’s not a line. There they come: two giant, mangy, snarling terrifying dogs, running at full speed towards you. You turn to look at SEWARD, who raises his shield for a moment and…

<<if $cheetos || $spade>>ZHWELCH. A black arrow hits him square in the toe. He tips over, squealing. The dogs will be on him soon. You lunge for your BACKPACK, and pull out the <<if $cheetos>>bag of CHEETOS<<else>>gardening SPADE<</if>>.

The dogs are closing on you. You can see the whites of their fangs. In your desperation, you <<if $cheetos>>fling the bag of CHEETOS in their path.

To your great astonishment, they stop, and sniff the bag. First curiously, and then the bite into it like the ravenous, blood-thirsty animals you assume them to be. 

Two feeling members of the MOB run up and grab SEWARD to drag him to safety. He looks at you, over his shoulder, as though you are a real hero: the wizard that saved his life. 

SEWARD: Take the castle! Long live RAMBO!

Right! You remember your purpose and turn back to your bag of tricks. 

[[Search your BACKPACK|Scene15C]]<<else>>brandish the gardening SPADE at them. They ignore that and run past you! Right to SEWARD, where they start to ravage him as he tries to kick them away. One of them bites SEWARD’s wooden shield cleanly in half, and looks up at you.

You throw the SPADE at them, missing badly. Your aim has always been terrible. But it scares them, and they run off back to the CASTLE, yelping. <<set $spade = false>>

Right, the CASTLE. You remember your purpose and turn back to your bag of tricks. 

[[Search your BACKPACK|Scene15C]]<</if>><<else>>ZHWELCH. A black arrow tears through SEWARD’s jaw. Blood sprays as the lower half of his face slides off. It is incredibly disgusting and gory. He wobbles, and two more arrows tear through his midsection, spilling his intestines in the dirt. This just got way too real.

The dogs are closing on you. You can see the whites of their fangs. Almost to you... You squeeze your eyes shut, bracing, and… they run past you! Right to SEWARD, where they start to ravage his still-twitching body. Really, way too gory. Even Game of Thrones didn’t have starving dogs eating people alive. One of them bites SEWARD’s wooden shield cleanly in half, and looks up at you. SEWARD has saved your life. 

You have to avenge him. You turn back to your bag of tricks.

You hate it here. Deep into a double-shift. Eyes almost watering from the circus color palette, bright stupid reds, yellows, and blues.

But it’s a job. Jack of All Fruits. The most ridiculous jester-themed smoothie bar in the ugliest strip mall in town. Every day you come here. Every day you’d rather be anywhere else.

You struggle to get the plastic lid on the latest order. The king-sized lids don’t fit the king-sized cups. Everybody always orders king-size. You squeeze too hard. Neon orange goo drips down the side of the cup.

You feel angry.

Finally the lid clicks with a pop and drops of the orange goo fleck your court jester uniform. You grab a dirty dishrag to try and blot it out, but you already know from experience that it will stain. You tug on your shirt, too tight even though it was the largest size they had.

You feel depressed. Then angry again.

Throw the cup, smoothie and all, straight at his stupid muscly chest. His eyebrows raise slowly, in genuine surprise. You both watch a gob of pink smoothie goo drip down his shirt and land on his knee.

One of the peekapoos starts licking it. The other has its nose in the cup, burrowing down into strawberry goo-ness.

Ernesto has pressed his back against the wall, as though you might lash out at him next. You instantly regret everything.

<<if $lightergrt && $smokes>>You light up one of Greta's cigarettes. Just to spite her.<<else>><</if>> You think about what kind of job you could get that doesn’t require any skill or work, that pays an infinite amount, and would garner you undying respect and adulation.

You try not to feel angry.

ERNESTO’S APARTMENT

It is nice of Ernesto to let you crash his apartment. Even if the couch is half-busted and you know there will be springs in your back all night. Everything you have is in your backpack, stashed in the least-dirty corner. <<if $cellphone>>At least you can charge your phone here.<<else>>Except your cellphone. You’re still kicking yourself for leaving it behind.<</if>> <<if not $cellphone && not $cash401>>You could have used that money to buy a new one.<<else>><</if>><<if not $cash401>> You keep thinking about that pile of cash in the backpack.<<else>><</if>>

It always feels a bit creepy to sleep here. ERNESTO is in too deep. There’s a replica medieval shield and two crossed swords hung on the wall above an elaborate display case full of small-scale fantasy figurines. The orcs are painted meticulously with slime. On Ernesto’s coffee table the Diabolical Dungeons game board is surrounded by WolfOut Energy cans and food wrappers.

You all have been at it for an hour, but it feels like aeons. DUNGEON MASTER DAN carefully arranges the pieces for the next sequence, clicking the plastic drawbridge into place on the set’s miniature castle. FRED coughs out smoke and passes you a ridiculous purple BONG. You don’t want him to know it’s yours, from the last time you were here. <<if $lightergrt>>You use Greta’s lighter to light it and try not to think about her.<<else>>You take a long draw.<</if>>

[[Make your next move|Scene3B]]

BERT: Well, fuck, I’ll just teleport onto the throne, if it’s empty. 

FRED: It’s empty because I’m on a quest.  Helping you. 

DUNGEON MASTER DAN: You can’t become King that way. 

BERT: I’ve been telling people to fuck off all day, right Ernesto?

ERNESTO: In a sense...

BERT: I’m a fucking wizard right? So I teleport. Once I’m on the throne...

DUNGEON MASTER DAN: You’re too high. It ruins the game if you don’t take it seriously. 

ERNESTO: C’mon Bert, you know that’s not how it’s played. 

DUNGEON MASTER DAN: You haven’t prepped that spell, so even with +2 modifier... You’d have to roll a twelve. 

[[Roll the dice|Scene3C]]


:: Scene3C {"position":"700,700","size":"100,100"}
You grab the plastic chalice with two dice, shake, and roll. One is a SIX, the other skitters off the game board, lodges against the BONG, stuck on the edge between FIVE and SIX. 

BERT: TWELVE! TELEPORT TO THE THRONE. 

FRED: Just sitting on the throne doesn’t make you...

DUNGEON MASTER DAN: That’s a Five. 

BERT: Six. 

ERNESTO: Guys. Maybe it’s a re-roll? 

DUNGEON MASTER DAN: It’s leaning Five. 

BERT: KING ME. 

You slam your fist down on the table. Not in anger. But it was harder than you meant to. The BONG tips over, spilling green water all over the carpet. ERNESTO jumps up. The dice lands on SIX. 

ERNESTO: Fuck, the carpet!

BERT: See, it was leaning six.

DUNGEON MASTER DAN: You’re a cheater.

Ernesto starts frantically unspooling paper towels.

ERNESTO: My landlord is gonna kill me!

BERT: As King, my first decree is to banish the DUNGEON MASTER DAN. 

DUNGEON MASTER DAN: The campaign is suspended.

You feel the blood rushing to your cheeks. 

[[Push it down|Scene3DSupress]]
[[Let it out|Scene3DAnger]]


:: Scene3DAnger {"position":"825,625","size":"100,100"}
If this stupid game doesn’t have any rules, why should you? You jump up and lunge at DUNGEON MASTER DAN, but he skitters out of the way, and you lurch into ERNESTO’s display case of table-top figurines. The replica swords come clattering down and the medieval shield cracks neatly in half, making a horrible noise. 

Everyone freezes and looks at ERNESTO, still on his knees mopping up bong water. You have destroyed his holy shrine. You actually feel really bad.  

BERT: Ernesto, I didn’t mean to, look...

ERNESTO holds up a shaking hand, silencing you. He picks up your backpack from the corner, and hands it to you. 

BERT: Ernesto, c’mon. I’ll take this shield and get it fixed at... um...

ERNESTO just points to the door. Time to pack up. <<set $jestervest = true>><<set $orcking = true>><<set $dice = true>><<set $lighterern = true>><<set $bong = true>><<set $shield = true>><<set $papertow = true>>

:: Scene3E {"position":"1075,700","size":"100,100"}
You put your backpack on, sighing. Ernesto holds the door open for you. He looks like he might cry. The other two won’t even look at you. They’re all kids anyway. With their stupid game. You shuffle out of the door. Then you remember you’ve got nowhere to go. You turn back to ERNESTO to ask...

BERT: Please?

ERNESTO slams the door in your face. No choice now:

[[Go to MA'S HOUSE|Scene4A]]


:: Scene4A {"position":"500,950","size":"100,100"}
MA’S HOUSE

You find yourself on the front porch of your two-story, dilapidated childhood home. Nowhere else to go. 

<<if $orcking>>You pull the tiny Orc King from your backpack. It's face is distorted into a hideous  grimace. You press it right up against the tiny peephole, and ring the doorbell. 

MA REYNOLDS: AAAHHHHHH. Also: Fuck off. 

BERT: Haha, Mom, it's me. 

MA REYNOLDS: If that's what you've done to your face, you're no son of mine. 

You hear her stomp away back into the house. She's not going to open the door now.

You knock. Wait. Knock again. A crack. 
<<else>>You hesitate, then sharply pound on the door. An extended amount of muffled cursing behind the door. Finally, it cracks open, still chained from the inside, and your Ma’s leathery face appears, cigarette pinched between her thin lips.

MA REYNOLDS: I’m asleep.

BERT: You’re smoking.

MA REYNOLDS: I already gave your allowance.
<<if $cash401>>
BERT: I have money...
<<else>><</if>>
She slams the door. You knock. Wait. Knock again. A crack.
<</if>>

MA REYNOLDS: You smell like <<if $bong>>a bong. And<<else>><</if>> Ernesto's apartment.

BERT: I got kicked out.

MA REYNOLDS: Try to find an apartment that doesn't stink this time.

She begins to close the door again. 

[[Push it open|Scene4BAnger]]
[[Let it close|Scene4BSupress]]


:: Scene4BAnger {"position":"625,1000","size":"100,100"}
You stick your foot in the door. She continues to try and push it shut. You wince at the pain. 

BERT: ...and I lost my job.

She opens the door a crack, still chained from the inside. She looks you up and down, raises a painted eyebrow at your striped jester work pants.

MA REYNOLDS: Still a push-over. Goes back to that time you peed yourself at your
birthday party and then...

NED: Who is it? No customers after 9!

NED used to be an accountant and still wears a bowtie every day. Ever since your Ma married him, she’s had even less patience for you. She ducks inside for a second, closing the door. Finally, it cracks open a final time. Her thin arm snakes out, dangling a bag of Cheetos.

MA REYNOLDS: Cellar’s open.

You throw up your hands in exasperation. She won’t even let you inside?

MA REYNOLDS: What? You need an old lady to open a door for you?

MA laughs, slams the door in your face. That’s twice today.

You sigh. Wringing sympathy from her has always been like pulling a sword from stone. She’s supposed to be your mother. 

[[Go around back|Scene4C]]


:: Scene4BSupress {"position":"625,875","size":"100,100"}
She closes the door, and you hear her shuffle away. 

BERT: ...and I lost my job.

NED: That stank too.

His insult comes from behind the closed door. Of course NED was there listening the whole time too. He used to be an accountant and still wears a bowtie every day. Ever since MA married him, you've hardly seen them apart. Wringing sympathy from her had always been hard. Now it was like pulling a sword from stone.

NED: Cheetos in the mailbox.

BERT: What...?

You open up the mailbox next to the front door. There is a bag of Cheetos inside. You have questions, but you can hear NED and MA shouting at each other upstairs now. They're not coming back. You sigh. 

[[Go around back|Scene4C]]


:: Scene4C {"position":"750,950","size":"100,100"}
You trudge around to the back of the house, past the familiar rusted lawn furniture and weeds. You set your BACKPACK down next to the giant cellar storm doors, which are bolted shut with a chain. 

You try to pull them open. Locked. You look around for something to use. All you can find is a BASEBALL from when you were a kid and an old rusted SPADE. Probably from the same time, you can barely remember when MA last tried gardening. 

Nothing else to do. <<if $bong>>You sit on the cellar doors, take the BONG out of your backpack. There still seems to be half a burnt bowl loaded.<<if $lightergrt || $lighterern>>You take out the lighter, light the bowl, and blow a big cloud of smoke into the night.<<else>>Then you realize you've failed to bring a lighter.

You lie back, under the stars, <<if $bong>>and feel the weed start to relax you.<<else>> and contemplate the vastness of the universe. Anything could happen, right?<</if>> Everything is fine, really. 

<<if $dice>>You roll the 6-sided die. It's a one. You roll again. It's a one.<<else>><</if>>

You doze off, wake up<<if $bong && ($lightergrt || $lighterern), take another bong rip<<else>>, eat another Cheeto<</if>>. <<if $dice>>You roll the die again. Another one.<<else>><</if>>Time passes... 

[[You fall ASLEEP.|Scene4D]]


:: Scene4D {"position":"875,950","size":"100,100"}
You startle awake at a lick on your hand. A tiny, scrawny cat <<if $cellphone>>has licked your phone clean of Cheeto dust and moved on to your fingers<<else>>has licked your fingers clean of Cheeto dust and is sniffling the bag<</if>>. Ignoring a coughing fit, you dig down into the bag. You offer a Cheeto to the cat, who takes it in her mouth, and trots off towards the house next door. 

You stand up and stare into the middle distance. Light is coming back into the sky. Life has come to this, then. 

A sudden jingling of the cat’s collar draws your attention to the house next door. It’s identical, but even more run-down than MA’s. JAN’s house. MA’s mortal enemy. But something is different: there’s a FOR SALE sign in the yard. The curtains are open. It looks like JAN has finally moved. Or died. You can only ever remember her having white hair. 

You can see inside her house, for the first time, and it’s surreal: it matches the house you grew up in , but it’s complete empty. Then, the first rays of the rising sun crest and illuminate a matching CELLAR DOOR, in JAN’s backyard. The cat scampers behind it, leading you on. 

Maybe you can stay in there, instead. It’s cold, you need to sleep, and clearly you’re not getting inside Ma’s house. Or cellar. You’ve scattered your things around the back yard. In the pre-dawn light, you gather them up to pack your bag... <<set $cheetos = true>><<set $baseball = true>><<set $spade = true>>

[[Open your BACKPACK|backpackmenu4]]


:: Scene5A {"position":"550,1200","size":"100,100"}
JAN'S CELLAR

After crossing the driveway into Jan's yard, you stop, clutch the straps of your backpack and look up at her darkened house. Your eye just catches some movement in an upper-story window. You think for a second, that it is JAN, watching you, but it can’t be, if she’s gone. 

You set your backpack on the edge of her older, rustier cellar doors. You pull, hard, and the lock breaks aways easily - it’s open. Framed by the early morning light, the cellar inside is pitch black. 

Suddenly the cat skitters out, and knocks your backpack into the dark. You bend forward, reaching after it, and step through the frame. Your foot expects to find the stairs, but instead, there’s nothing, and you tumble forward, head first...

[[... in to the DARKNESS.|Scene5B]]


:: Scene5B {"position":"675,1200","size":"100,100"}
The fall was just far enough, that you somersaulted to land on your ass. It really hurts, you’ll have a bruise on your tailbone. But you're lucky you didn’t land on your head. 

You start feeling around in the dark for your backpack. <<if $lightergrt || $lighterern>>It’s got that lighter inside.<<else>>Why didn't you bring that lighter?<</if>>Your hand reaches something soft... but too soft. An old blanket? You feel in the other direction, and find it. 

<<if $lightergrt || $lighterern>>You get the lighter out, and you’re just about to turn it on when you hear...<<else>>You find your backpack and start unzipping it when you hear...<</if>> baa-ing? A sheep? There’s sheep in here?!

You reach again, for the soft thing, and it bleats! You jump up, and see a tiny crack of light in the far wall. Freaked out, you sling your backpack and rush towards it.

The light forms the outline of a closed door, daylight filtering in. You squelch your way toward it, desperate, through the shuffling and bleating around you. Definitely sheep. Definitely shit. Flies buzz madly. You have to get away from the smell. 

The door is stuck. You bash your weight against it until it gives, and you trip...

[[... OUTSIDE.|Scene5C]]


:: Scene5C {"position":"800,1200","size":"100,100"}
THE COUNTRY-SIDE

A vast rolling green expanse unfurls before you. There’s a PEASANT HUT just between you and the SHEEP BARN you’ve stepped out of. And the near horizon, framed in majestic sunlight, is a medieval CASTLE. It’s... the middle ages. 

BERT: Oh. Shit.

You look down, your sneakers are covered in sheep shit. 

You’re not dreaming. <<if $bong && ($lightergrt || $lighterern)>>You’re not high (anymore). <<else>><</if>>You just found a portal to medieval times. 

You look around in wonder. The air is fresh, there’s sparkling dew on the grass, butterflies, it’s like a movie. You hear voices, coming from inside the hut. 

[[Go to PEASANT’S HUT. |Scene5D]]


:: Scene5D {"position":"925,1200","size":"100,100"}
PEASANT’S HUT

There’s no door, so you step inside...

…to be met with a full-volume scream. The piercing shriek belongs to a peasant woman, clutching a BABY, also screaming.  

CICILIA: Seward!!  

SEWARD: Cicilia!?  

They have names. Weird medieval names. SEWARD bursts in, brandishing a pitchfork.  

CICILIA: It’s a DEMON! With… a DEMON INSIDE HIM!  

You look down at your shirt, the creature from the depths drawn as though it is ripping through the fabric of the shirt itself.  

BERT: Technically, it’s a Balrog.  

SEWARD: Relent, evil fiend!  

He pokes at you with the pitchfork. You back into the corner. It looks really sharp, actually. <<if $jestervest>>You swing your BACKPACK around and try to tug your JESTER VEST out in order to cover up the Balrog. <<else>>You swing your BACKPACK around to protect your soft belly. <</if>> 

SEWARD: Prepare to be banish’d to the foul realm which birthed you!  

SEWARD cranks the pitchfork back to deliver a death blow. 

[[Reach into your BACKPACK.|Scene5E]]


:: Scene5E {"position":"1050,1200","size":"100,100"}

Everyone stops. CICILIA, BABY, and SEWARD fall silent. The pitchfork clatters to the floor.

SEWARD drops to his knees.  

SEWARD: Our apologies, mighty one. You bless our home with your presence.

BERT: Can you keep an eye on my…  

CICILIA: Chalice?

BERT: Yes.  

You set the BONG down awkwardly, and it tips over again, spilling water on the floor of the hut. The BABY resumes his unhappy cry. CICILIA drops her sultry look.  You give her an apologetic shrug.<<else>>You give her an awkward thumbs up.<</if>>

ROAD TO THE CASTLE

You follow SEWARD, who walks a few paces ahead of you. The scenery is idyllic, the huts along the road are quaint, but you can’t stop glancing into the ditch next to the road. It’s filled with shit, garbage, animal carcasses, and dancing flies. A nasty-ass rat gives you a disbelieving look.

BERT: Take me to your leader! Haha.

SEWARD: I beg your pardon?

BERT: Aliens… Forget it. So, your wife’s… sister?

SEWARD: Every maiden, when she comes of age, must present herself at the castle. Some never return.

BERT: That sounds… Every woman, huh? So your wife's sister…

SEWARD: Whether my wife is bereaved or jealous, I cannot say, all I know is she blames me. But as a serf bound in vassalage to the King, I am completely powerless. My lot is hopeless.

BERT: That’s my… I… I completely understand your feelings.

SEWARD: What is a feelings?

SEWARD lifts his cap to scratch at his filthy hair.

BERT: Uh… A modern thing, maybe. Never mind. Do you have…

SEWARD: Fleas. I am punish’d, for I spoke once against the King.

BERT: Oh, good. I mean... I thought it was the Black Plague, or whatever.

SEWARD: The castle is just over yonder hill. I dare not approach with you, the King would have my head and those of my fleas. I remain the coward my wife describes. I wish you well, oh mighty RAMBO.

SEWARD takes a deep bow, and scrambles away.

THE CASTLE

Right, you are Rambo. You take a deep breath. You crest the hill, and there it is—a magnificent medieval CASTLE, with banners unfurled and snapping in the wind. It’s big. Imposing. Your stomach feels like you just drank three king-size smoothies. The large wooden drawbridge is pulled up and as you approach, an ARCHER appears on the ramparts.

ARCHER: Who goes there?

BERT: It is I… RAMBO OF STRIPMALLSHIRE!

There is no response. You reach into your BACKPACK. <<if $lightergrt || $lighterern>>You flick the LIGHTER and hold it above your head, to show your power.<<elseif $orcking>>You hold the ORC KING above your head, to show your power. But there's no way he could see it from up there.<<elseif $baseball>>You take out your BASEBALL, and crank it back, as though you'll attack hin with it. <<elseif $smokes>>You pull out the SMOKES, and hold them up.

And run. And run.

Until you’re out of breath, which is not that far, really. Just over the hill. But at least you’re out of arrow range. You try to catch your breath, try to think. You can’t stay here. This place is crazy.

[[Walk back to SEWARD’S HUT|Scene6C]]


:: Scene6C {"position":"850,1350","size":"100,100"}
SEWARD’S HUT

Exhausted, sun-burnt, you stumble back into the SEWARD’S HUT. CICILIA is there, now with two babies, asleep in the crib. <<if $bong>>She holds your BONG, running her fingers along it. <<else>>When she sees you, she slips the shoulder of her dress down. <</if>><<set $bong = false>><<set $LEFTbong = true>>OK, that’s definitely a seductive look.

BERT: Where is...

CICILIA: He’s told the others of your arrival. And your intentions.

You look out the door. It’s an angry mob of villagers. They even have pitchforks and torches. No joke. You look at CICILIA. Her babies start screaming. Damn. You're going to have to run again. You take a deep breath.

[[Make for the BARN.|Scene6D]]


:: Scene6D {"position":"975,1350","size":"100,100"}
You burst out of the HUT, ducking in the hope that somehow the mob doesn’t spot you. They do, and start to rush after you. Already winded, you break into a loping run<<if $cellphone>> and pull your CELL PHONE out of your pocket. You struggle to dial 911 while running. You stop to press send and see there’s no signal. That makes sense. No cell service in medieval times.<<else>>.<</if>>

The mob is closing in. You dive into the BARN and slip, face-planting into sheep shit. You wrestle yourself up again, trying to wipe it out of your eyes. In the ceiling, you spot a door. The cellar door. The one you fell in through. The ceiling is low, but the edge is still just out of reach. 

You drop your BACKPACK to lighten your load. You step on a sheep’s back, it emits a loud BAAAAA of objection, but you manage to pull yourself up and grip the edge of the door frame. 

[[Go through the CELLAR DOOR.|Scene6E]]


:: Scene6E {"position":"1100,1350","size":"100,100"}
You wrench yourself through the door, and look around to see... the same medieval sky. On top of the roof, you see the mob surrounding the BARN. <<if $item>>You throw your CELL PHONE at them, uselessly.<<else>><</if>><<set $cellphone = false>><<set $LEFTcellphone = true>>


BERT: Fuck!

You drop back inside. The mob is bashing at the BARN door. You push sheep up against it, trying to keep them out. But they immediately run to the far side of the pen. 

You search in your BACKPACK, desperate for something, anything, that you could use against the advancing villagers. <<if $spade>>You pick the SPADE, open the door, and brandish it.<<elseif $papertow>>You pick the PAPER TOWELS, open the door, and brandish the roll.<<elseif $cash401>>You pick the CASH, open the door, and brandish the stack of bills.<<elseif $shield>>You pick the SHIELD, open the door, and brandish it.<<elseif $baseball>>You pick the BASEBALL, open the door, and cock it back, like you'll bean them with it.<<elseif $orcking>>You pick the ORC KING, open the door, and brandish it, making orc noises.<<else>>There's nothing good. You open the door to see if they are still there.<</if>> The Mob roars. You slam the door.

That didn’t work. You strap the BACKPACK across your front again, hoping it’ll protect against the stab of pitchforks. When you do, the sunlight above you suddenly goes dark. You duck, thinking at first that the villagers have climbed onto the roof and are blocking out the light. 

When no one drops down into the barn, you look up: the door in the roof is still open, but now you can see a starry sky through the frame. Even though the daylight still shines though the cracks in the barn walls. The lights of a plane slowly blink overhead. It’s the portal. Home. 

[[Go through the CELLAR DOOR.|Scene6F]]


:: Scene6F {"position":"1225,1350","size":"100,100"}
You try to climb a sheep again, which slips away. You grab another, humping it into position. You clamor on top, again pull yourself up through the door frame, your feet dangling. The mob is inside the BARN. Someone stabs your shoe with a pitchfork. It falls off. You scream. 

With all your strength, which is barely enough, you pull yourself...

[[... in to the DARKNESS.|Scene7A]]


:: Scene7A {"position":"650,1550","size":"100,100"}
JAN'S CELLAR

Back up through the cellar door, you fall face-first in the yard. Bermuda grass. You jump up, still panicked, and search your BACKPACK for your CELL PHONE: Right. Gone. 

JAN’S house looms in the setting sun, behind you. Your eye again catches movement from above, making you jump. A shadowy figure moves away from the upstairs window. Your body shudders. 

You've got to move. You've only got one shoe.

[[Run back to to MA’S HOUSE.|Scene7B]]


:: Scene7B {"position":"775,1550","size":"100,100"}
MA’S HOUSE

You crash through the front door. You stumble down the hall, grab a cracked yellow handset phone off the wall and dial 911 with trembling hands.

OPERATOR: 911. What’s your emergency?

BERT: I… door… Serfs…

OPERATOR: Caller, what’s your emergency?

You realize you can’t explain what’s happened. And there’s not a mob behind you, now. And you’re out of breath. You hang up the phone.

Maybe you hit your head when you fell into the cellar? And it was all a bad dream? As though in answer, a bit of straw falls from your hair. It sticks in the sheep shit that’s covering the one shoe you have left. Definitely real.

MA REYNOLDS: Jesus Christ on a Stick, Bert. You shit yourself in your sleep? Take a shower.

You know you've got something to prove to MA where you've been. 

[[Search your BACKPACK|Scene7C]]


:: Scene7C {"position":"900,1550","size":"100,100"}
But there's nothing in your BACKPACK from medieval times. You failed to bring anything back. 

You start to explain instead. JAN's cellar, the sheep, the castle, Cicilia, and where did her extra baby come from? MA keeps her distance, using one hand to hold her nose and the other to hurry you along. In the end, she just throws up her hands.

MA REYNOLDS: Sounds like you’ve been smoking too much. No more allowance. Need to sell this shit anyhow.

She gathers her tie-dye bathrobe around her and turns to bag weed from an enormous pile on her kitchen counter. This has been her profession ever since she got with NED–weed dealer. You would object, but she’s actually your weed dealer.

BERT: But Jan’s house?

MA REYNOLDS: She left last year. Finally. And no surprise that no one wants her dumpy old shack. Don’t go over there. Not even for one of your stupid stories.

BERT: It’s not a story. Look, my<<if $LEFTbong>>bong<<elseif $LEFTcellhone>>cell phone<<else>>shoe<</if>> is gone—I left it with the… serfs, it’s not on this side anymore. See?

You open your BACKPACK to show her.

MA REYNOLDS: Your proof is that you lost your <<if $LEFTbong>>bong<<elseif $LEFTcellhone>>cell phone<<else>>shoe<</if>> and the smurfs have it? Your father would hate this hogwash.

MA reaches over to affectionately touch a framed portrait of Burt Reynolds, in its usual place on her kitchen counter.

She cackles. It’s a life-long running joke that makes her laugh every time. You still don’t get it.

MA REYNOLDS: Aw, JUNIOR! Seriously, you need to get your ass outta here before Ned gets back and gets a whiff.

BERT: Ma. I don’t have anywhere to go.

MA REYNOLDS: Well, you can’t stay here. Not without some rent money. If your backpack is a portal, beam up some cold hard cash. 

You pick up your BACKPACK. 

BERT: It's a JanSport, actually. 

MA REYNOLDS: You mean a JansPortal!

As she cackles, you feel the anger rising again.

She snatches the wad of cash from you. You suddenly realize that you probably do have a final paycheck waiting for you. Great, you'll be able to pay rent to MA twice, at least. <<set $cash401 = false>>

Without turning, MA waves you upstairs. You take off your one shoe and carry it so you don't track sheep shit up the stairs. You hold up the piece of straw to show her.

BERT: Look!

MA REYNOLDS: Wow. Congrats, Dorothy. You’re back in Kansas. Now, how're you gonna make hay?

BERT: I could do the distribution. Instead of Ned.

MA REYNOLDS: He knows how to use Excel! TECHNOLOGY, Bert—that’s a skill. Ned’s not a grubby little grasper like you. Anyone who wants power should be immediately disqualified. Like cops.

Technology. Power. You feel an idea start to form somewhere in the back of your mind.

BERT: Ma? Don’t tell anyone about me and Jan's cellar door, OK?

MA REYNOLDS: Believe me, son, I don’t mention you.

Her cackle follows you down the hall.

You undress in the bathroom upstairs, pulling off the Balrog shirt and your striped jester pants. The bright red, yellow, and blue pattern fills you with dread. You'd rather face the castle again than return to Jack of All Fruits. 

In the shower, you watch sheep shit run in streaks down the drain. You marvel that it must be 1000 years old. If only you had brought back better proof. 

After the shower, you retreat to your childhood bedroom. Someone else might guess that MA kept your childhood bedroom exactly as it was out of fondness or nostalgia, but you know it's just because she was too lazy to deal with it. Boxes and unused workout equipment are arrayed around the small single bed. 

On the wardrobe, covered in dust, is one of your old softball trophies and another framed portrait of Burt Reyonds. You turn it face down. 

You lie down on the bed. You are very tired. 

You wake up what feels like minutes—or days—later, on top of the covers. You can hear MA and NED shouting at each other downstairs. The morning light is coming in through the curtains. 

You get up, get dressed. Your one remaining shoe is still covered in shit, you need to take care of that. But no time now. You find a pair of NED's slippers, and slide them out from under the bed. Slipping your foot into one, you feel something. 

There's a LASER POINTER in the slipper. NED is so weird. You take it out and put the slipper on. Time to get out of here. <<set $trophy = true>><<set $jesterpant = true>><<set $burtreyn = true>><<set $pointer = true>>

JACK OF ALL FRUITS

You hover in the parking lot for over thirty minutes before finally mustering the strength to set foot back inside Jack of All Fruits. You approach the counter sheepishly. ERNESTO stands behind the counter and stops the smoothie machine mid-pour when he sees you. He goes pale, like you’re a ghost.

ERNESTO: Greta already hired someone else.

BERT: Can I ask you something?

You lean over the counter and lower your voice.

BERT: What kind of technology would you use to storm a castle? You know, as just one… wizard.

ERNESTO: Nobody wants to play with you anymore, Bert. After the other night, you’re out of the game.

BERT: No, I know. This is real. I mean hypothetical. What would you do?

ERNESTO: Probably a fireball spell. Maybe a suit of armor for defense.

BERT: A suit of armor…

ERNESTO: Or a shield. Like the one you broke, which I got at my first Ren Fair. That cost me $400.

You point at the...
BODY ARMOR, a GUN, and a FLAMETHROWER.

RAMBO: Not for you.

BERT: Oh, OK. Of course. Then the… suit of armor? I mean, the body armor.

RAMBO slowly stirs. He sees the trembling stack of CASH clenched in your hand. He glances up to meet your eye. Does he somehow know you’ve been using his name?

He slowly turns and plucks a large SWAT-style bulletproof BODY ARMOR vest from a hook.

BERT: Does it only stop bullets? Or other things too… like arrows?

RAMBO: Spin.

You’re confused. RAMBO makes a little swirly circle with his finger. You really don't want to turn your back on him. Especially after what happened with the arrows. 

You SPOIN and go to Scene 9C
